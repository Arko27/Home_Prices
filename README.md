# Home_Prices
Here a Linear Regression Model has been made for the dataset of Houses to predict the Price of a House given certain parameters. The model is trained against **Area, Bedrooms and Age**  of the House.
<br> The Linear Regression Model is taken from the sklearn.linear-model package of Python.
<br> I have tested the model for various inputs and the overall score of the model is 95.50%.
